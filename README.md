# Early Risk Analytics: FNU and OULAD

## Project Overview
This project examines whether **early student engagement** during the first weeks of a course can be used to predict **academic risk**, including failure or withdrawal.

The project was developed as a **Google Data Analytics Capstone** and uses two datasets:
- **FNU Analytics** (internal institutional dataset)
- **OULAD** (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset – public benchmark)

The goal is to identify early warning signals that allow institutions to intervene **before** students fail or withdraw.
