# Early Risk Analytics: FNU and OULAD

## Project Overview
This project examines whether **early student engagement** during the first weeks of a course can be used to predict **academic risk**, including failure or withdrawal.

The project was developed as a **Google Data Analytics Capstone** and uses two datasets:
- **FNU Analytics** (internal institutional dataset)
- **OULAD** (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset – public benchmark)

The goal is to identify early warning signals that allow institutions to intervene **before** students fail or withdraw.

## Business Question
Can early student engagement during the first weeks of a course be used to predict academic risk and support timely intervention?

---

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server** – data modeling, cleaning, aggregation, and analytical views  
- **Excel** – data modeling and validation  
- **R / RStudio** – analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling  
- **GitHub** – documentation and portfolio publication

## Key Analysis Steps
1. Data engineering and modeling in SQL Server  
2. Creation of analytical views for reuse  
3. Early engagement analysis in R  
4. Early-risk classification (bottom 25% activity)  
5. Logistic regression to predict pass probability  
6. Comparison between FNU and OULAD results  

---

## Key Findings
- Students with **low early engagement** are significantly more likely to fail or withdraw  
- Early engagement patterns are **consistent across institutions**  
- Simple early-risk rules can support timely and effective intervention
